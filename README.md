# Trucking Takes The Long Winding Road Downwards 


### Write your nutgraf here

More than half a million jobs in transportation and warehousing were lost in April. The unemployment rate for the sector rose to 13.5% for the same month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The industry began struggling in February, when factory shutdowns in China caused supply chain backups and eventually a drop in goods moving across the U.S. Then the lockdowns hit North America, causing the industry to take a second hit when businesses shut down and shipping demand dropped even further.

## Describe how and where you found the data with links to sources. Put the raw data (csv format) in a folder called `data` in this folder. Make a folder called `notebooks` where you will write your pandas code.
 
 Data was found from the Burea of Labor Statistics, CASS Information Systems (An industry leading data analytics provider for freight services), DAT Analytics (An industry leading data analytics provider for freight services), and the U.S. Department of Transportation. 

Write up at least one or up to three findings from your analysis based on the data you found.

- Trcuking spot-rates hit an all time low in April. 
- March saw a sharp spike upwards in spot-rates when shippers were scrambling to find carriers for the rapid shift in demand.
- States such as Nevada Utah and Kansas saw some of the lowest spot rates relative to the nation.
- States such as Washington, DC saw the highest increase in freight charges over a one month period for latest available data, in contrast, Arizona saw the highest decrease for the same perdion. 

## Who are some potential human sources you could reach out to for more info?
Below are all people I spoke to for the artcile:
1. Tali Haleua, founder of Fuelogistics, freight company
2. Mickey Blashfield, president and CEO of the Michigan Trucking Association
3. Garland Hutson, manager at CM Truckbeds, a company that supplies bodies for trucks.
4. A public relations associate at DAT Freight Analytics 

## What is the maximum (best) story possible? What's the minimum (fallback) story if your hypothesis doesn't prove out?

Detailed insight as to why the rates dropped and how the industry will recover would be best possible story. Fall back would be an overall outlook of the trends without being able to back it up woth real people stories. However, I was able to achieve real people insight and insert it into data.
